# Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Robot
Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. Using the concept of gesture recognition, it is possible to point a finger at the computer screen so that the cursor will move accordingly. This could potentially make conventional input devices such as mouse, keyboards and even touch screens redundant . I propose a fast algorithm for automatically recognizing a limited set of gestures from hand for a robot control application. The mobile robot used by us is a FireBird V Atmega 2560 micro controlled robot designed by ERTS lab CSE IIT Bombay. Hand gesture recognition is a challenging problem in its general form. By considering a fixed set of manual commands and a reasonably structured environment, and develop a simple, yet effective, procedure for gesture recognition. Our approach contains steps for segmenting the hand region, locating the fingers, and finally classifying the gesture. The algorithm is invariant to translation, rotation, and scale of the hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on real imagery.
